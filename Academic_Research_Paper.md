# An Integrated AI-Powered Legal Document Analysis and Query Resolution System: Design, Implementation, and Performance Evaluation

## Abstract

This paper presents an innovative integrated system for legal document analysis and intelligent query resolution, specifically designed for Indian legal frameworks. The system comprises two core original tools: (1) a Legal Document Analyzer Pipeline for multi-format document processing and analysis, and (2) a Knowledge Graph-based Legal Query Resolution System. The implementation leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, graph-based knowledge representation, and large language models to provide comprehensive legal document understanding and intelligent query answering. The system demonstrates significant improvements in legal document processing efficiency, achieving automated segmentation, citation extraction, and plain-language summarization while maintaining high accuracy in legal query resolution through semantic similarity matching and contextual knowledge graph traversal. Performance evaluations indicate the system's capability to handle diverse legal document types including court judgments, contracts, statutes, and legal notices with processing times under 2 minutes for typical documents and query response times under 30 seconds.

## 1. Introduction

The legal profession faces unprecedented challenges in managing the exponential growth of legal documents and the complexity of legal information retrieval. Traditional legal research methods are time-intensive and prone to human error, particularly when dealing with large volumes of legal texts. The emergence of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technologies presents significant opportunities to revolutionize legal document analysis and query resolution systems.

This research presents a comprehensive solution addressing these challenges through the development of an integrated AI-powered legal document analysis and query resolution system. The system uniquely combines automated document processing with intelligent knowledge graph-based query resolution, specifically tailored for Indian legal frameworks.

The system architecture incorporates two original, independently designed tools that work synergistically: Tool 1 focuses on comprehensive legal document analysis and processing, while Tool 2 implements an advanced knowledge graph-based query resolution mechanism. This dual-tool approach enables both document-centric analysis and query-driven legal research, providing a complete solution for legal professionals.

## 2. Problem Statement
